<h4>Searching and Browsing the Library</h4>

<p>There are two ways to view the library resources, including books,
magazines, periodicals, videos, music, and hanging files.</p>

<p>The first method is to <b>Browse</b> the collection. Simply click on
the Browse button on the left side of the screen. You may optionally
select a particular type of media (books only, periodicals only, etc) or a
particular topic (computers, magazines, etc).</p>

<p>The second method is to <b>Search</b> for an exact word or phrase. In
the Search box to the lower left of your screen, click on one of the
buttons beside <i>Title</i> or <i>Author</i>. Next enter your search text
in the blank field. Finally, click on the Search button.</p>

<p>Your results will be displayed to the right side of the screen. You can
learn more about the search results by clicking on the <i>View</i> link on
the far right of each resource listing.</p>

<small><b>Technical Note:</b> The Search is case-insensitive and matches 
exact phrases. If you type part of a word, Search will find all 
occurrences of that word fragment.</small>

<h4>Signing Out Resources</h4>

<p>In order to sign out a resource, you must visit our
drop-in-center/office during Office Hours.</p>

<p>You may sign out a resource for three weeks. An office volunteer will
ask you for your name and either a phone number or email that you can be
reached at. This information will be kept confidential. Should the
resource become overdue, you will be contacted and reminded to return the
resource.</p>

<h4>Contact Us</h4>

<p>If you have any questions about the library or would like to sign out a
resource, please contact us by phone or email.

<h4>Volunteer Help</h4>

<p>Our Volunteers wishing to sign-out or return a resource must <b>login
